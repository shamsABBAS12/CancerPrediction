machine Learning Classification algorithm

Cancer Prediction Classification ML Project

Developed a Cancer Prediction System using Python and 6+ libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit, NumPy), capable of predicting cancer presence with over 90% test accuracy using an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Cleaned and engineered a 2,000+ record medical dataset, creating a custom preprocessing pipeline to impute missing values, scale numerical features, and encode 7+ categorical featuresâ€”significantly boosting model performance.

Conducted deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with 20+ visualizations (count plots, heatmaps, KDEs, bar charts) to understand patient trends, uncover symptom correlations, detect outliers, and shape feature engineering strategy.

Trained and compared 5 classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM), selecting SVM as the final model based on superior precision, recall, and F1-score across multiple test sets.

Deployed the model using Streamlit & Hugging Face Spaces, building a fully interactive cancer prediction web app where users input features like Age, Tumor Size, Smoking History, etc., and receive real-time predictions like "Cancer Detected" or "No Cancer Detected".



ðŸ§¬ Cancer Prediction System using ML & Streamlit (Classification Project)
Developed a Cancer Prediction System using real-world medical data of 2,000+ patients, implementing multiple ML classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM to predict the likelihood of cancer.

Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with 25+ visualizations (count plots, heatmaps, pairplots) to uncover relationships between lifestyle, tumor characteristics, and cancer presenceâ€”leading to stronger feature insights.

Cleaned and transformed raw health data, handling missing values, encoding 6+ categorical features (e.g., Tumor Grade, Smoking History), and scaling numerical values using custom Scikit-learn pipelines for robust preprocessing.

Achieved over 90% accuracy with Support Vector Machine (SVM)â€”outperforming other modelsâ€”showcasing high generalization power across unseen patient profiles.

Deployed a real-time web application using Streamlit and Hugging Face Spaces, enabling users to input patient details (Age, Tumor Size, Family History, etc.) and instantly receive predictions: "Cancer Detected" or "No Cancer Detected" via an interactive UI.
